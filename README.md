# AI-Augmented Cybersecurity Workflows

The Department of Defense (DoD) cybersecurity workforce faces an ever-growing challenge in safeguarding national security infrastructure against increasingly sophisticated threats. In this dynamic landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) presents a powerful opportunity to enhance cybersecurity operations. However, for many professionals, the transition from completing an online course to effectively applying AI in real-world cybersecurity scenarios remains unclear.

To bridge this gap, AI Sensei was developedâ€”an initiative designed to equip the DoD workforce with the skills and knowledge needed for AI integration. By facilitating AI readiness, AI Sensei empowers personnel to seamlessly incorporate AI into existing workflows and explore new applications. This project focuses on expanding and refining the AI Sensei website, enhancing its capabilities to better support the DoD cybersecurity community.

# React App Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
